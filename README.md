# Kyle-s-Flashlight
#####A flashlight app for Android phones as low as API 7

This is the first Android app that I made.
You can download it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kyle.flashlight&hl=en)!
Below is the description for my app which can also be found by following the link above.

>I made this app for android phones because I wanted to produce my first android app without the help of my professors, and I wanted it to be something useful to me. Granted, I could have gotten a flashlight from the app store, but I wanted one that didn't have any weird permission requirements and was an app that I knew did only what I expected and nothing more. This app does require the use of your camera in order to use the flashlight, and because it needs access to your camera, Google says it needs to "take pictures". You will find that all flashlight apps have this permission requirement, but the funny thing is that most of them (at least mine) do NOT take any pictures at all. This app is literally just a flashlight, and that makes me happy! :D

>*** This app may not work for your phone model if any of the following conditions apply to you.***  
1. You have a flashlight app already installed on your phone.  
2. You unknowingly already have a pre-installed flashlight app on your phone. (this was true for a friend of mine)  
3. You have yet to restart your phone after downloading the app.  

>These conditions often lead to problems with flashlight apps in general. If you are experiencing trouble with this app, and none of the above conditions apply to you. Please email me (using my email provided below) with a brief description of your issue (ex. app won't open, or app opens but flash doesn't turn on, etc.), the version of Android that is running on your phone, and your phone's model number. This information can usually be found by going to "Settings --> About Phone". This information will help me to better diagnose your issue and fix the problem. I will be sure to respond to you in a timely manner with the results of my efforts to solve your issue.
Thank you for choosing my flashlight app! :)
