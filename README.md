# Kyle-s-Flashlight

### Introduction
This was the first Android app I've ever made. I made this app for android phones because I wanted to produce my first android app without the help of my professors, and I wanted it to be something useful to me. Granted, I could have gotten a flashlight from the app store, but I wanted one that didn't have any weird permission requirements and was an app that I knew did only what I expected and nothing more. This app does require the use of your camera in order to use the flashlight, and because it needs access to your camera, Google says it needs to "take pictures". You will find that all flashlight apps have this permission requirement, but the funny thing is that most of them (at least mine) do NOT take any pictures at all. This app is literally just a flashlight, and that makes me happy! :D

### Getting Started
You can easily find [Kyle's Flashlight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kyle.flashlight&hl=en) on the Google Play Store!

**\*\*EDIT\*\***  
Sometime after releasing this application, the Google Play Store started requiring developers to have a privacy policy for any application they owned on the store. By this time, most phones came preinstalled with a flashlight on them. I felt it wasn't worth the effort to continue updating my application whenever Google changed its policies, so I removed Kyle's Flashlight from the Google Play Store. If you'd still like to try out the application, check out the [latest release](https://github.com/kwilliams3/Kyle-s-Flashlight/releases/tag/Cherry-Pie) where you can download the .apk for it.

### Disclaimer
This app may not work on your phone if any of the following conditions apply to you. These conditions often lead to problems with flashlight apps in general.
1. You have a flashlight app already installed on your phone.  
2. You have yet to restart your phone after downloading the app.
